Optimization Project - Maximum Edge Subgraph Problem

This repository contains the implementation and testing of optimization methods to find high-quality solutions for the Maximum Edge Subgraph Problem.
Objectives

The aim of this project was to conceive, implement, and test optimization methods that would find high-quality solutions for different instances of the problem described below.
Maximum Edge Subgraph Problem

The Maximum Edge Subgraph Problem consists of, given an undirected graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, A) and an integer value k, finding a subset of k vertices such that the number of edges within the subset is maximized.
Formal Definition

Given:

    An undirected graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, A) composed of a set V of vertices connected by edges A.
    An integer k.

Problem:

    Find a subset of vertices S, of size k, such that 𝑆 ⊆ 𝑉, in order to maximize the number of edges in this subset.

The objective of this problem is therefore maximization.
